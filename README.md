# Bootcamp-Project

In this Project I have made a Python program using hashlib library of python also included salting of hashes by a differnt library binascii library.
The output can be checked by providing a string value to the program.
Kindly run the program in google colab.
I tried my best to keep the program short any changes required please let me know

Thank you

Whirlpool is a cryptographic hash function created by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S.L.M. Barreto. It was first published in 2000 and revised in 2001 and 2003. It was derived form square and Advanced Encryption Standard. It is a block cipher hash function and designed after square block cipher. It takes less than 2^256 bits length input and convert it in 512 bit hash.

Hashing is mainly used for authentication purposes. Salting makes password hashing more secure. Salting is an extra action during hashing. If two clients have the same password, they will also have the same password hashes. A salt, which is a random series of characters, is an extra input to the password before hashing. This makes an alternate hash result for the two passwords.
